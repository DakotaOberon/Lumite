Created for the GameMaker Studio #NoticeMe game jam

I hope this projects contains something that helps you finish your project!

This probably won't be updated by me further but I'd still love to know how/if this project helps others learn GameMaker Studio 2

---

The code here was written in less than 2 weeks while in the midst of a move to the other side of the world. Because of this, comments and documentation are missing in large portions of the project. If you are interested in the project and need help understanding a portion of the code, please feel free to reach out to me and I'll try to answer your questions.
Thank you for checking out the project!
